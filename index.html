  <h1>Shrine for Maple</h1>
  <p>This page is dedicated to our house's cat, Maple. She has a big personality and bigger flab. <em>Don't</em> make her angry; you won't like her when she's angry.</p>

  <p>Things Maple likes to do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bite me when I change my room around</li>
    <li>Ask for pets and then bite when she receives them</li>
    <li>Stare out the window at all the cars and then mess up the blinds</li>
    <li>Knock over bags of dice from the D&D shelves</li>
    <li>Find a bowl of paperclips and empty the bowl one paperclip at a time, flinging them off of the table she's not supposed to be on</li>
  </ul>

  <p>She is mean but we love her anyway.</p>
